  ## ðŸš€ Quick start

  1.  **Setup this site.**

      Use the Gatsby CLI to Clone this site.

      ```sh
      # Clone this Repositories
      gatsby new your-project-name https://github.com/sra1rdy/laxmi-artist-gatsby-contentful
      ```

  1.  **Start developing.**

      Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

      ```sh
      cd MyArts/
      gatsby develop
      ```

  1.  **Setup your Own Configure Projects.**

      Enter your own key

      [ContentFul](https://be.contentful.com/login):
      - spaceId = **Key**
      - accessToken = **Key**
